# Project Abstract
We investigate the performance of a robotic system that is solely
controlled based upon manipulations to a video feed, otherwise
known as a computer vision dependent system. We fulfilled a
modified version of two 2022 Roboboat objectives while also
considering conditions present and resources available. Through
applications of robotic design, implementation and creation of
computer vision systems, design of computer interfacing
systems, and creation of parts through 3D printing, we were able
to successfully complete the objectives. Ultimately, this project
was instrumental in demonstrating our mastery of mechatronic
systems.
